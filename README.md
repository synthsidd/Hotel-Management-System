ðŸ”° Beginner Project with Python ðŸ”°
As part of my journey in learning Python as programming language, I recently created a Simple Hotel Management System using core programming concepts. This beginner-level project allows users to book rooms, view availability, check out, and manage bookingsâ€”all via a clean text-based interface.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of the Project:
 To gain hands-on experience with real-world problem-solving through Python, focusing on how a basic hotel booking system might work internally.

ðŸ’» Tech Used:
Python (Core Programming)
Conditional Statements, Loops, Lists, and Functions
Input/Output Handling 

ðŸ§  Skills Practiced:
Writing clean, modular code
Logical thinking and control flow
Debugging and improving user interaction
Designing a menu-driven interface

ðŸ“ˆ Outcome & Learning:
 âœ… Improved understanding of how real-life applications can be mapped to code
 âœ… Learned to simulate real-world tasks using simple data structures
 âœ… Boosted my confidence in coding with functions and loops
